# Tail-Light-FSM
VHDL Quartus Project for Digital Design simulating a tail light on an altera FPGA. There are 3 inputs from switches corresponding to left turn signal, right turn signal and hazards, and 6 outputs to LEDs (3 for each side).

The project code demonstrates structural VHDL design using multiple design files, as well as a finite state machine that consists of a process for registers and another for input/output logic.
